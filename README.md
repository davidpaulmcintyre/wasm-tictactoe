# State Management With WebAssembly &Â Rust
My game based off of different game described at [Medium](https://seanwatters.medium.com/state-management-with-webassembly-rust-66d80432959f) and [Dev.to](https://dev.to/seanwatters/state-management-with-webassembly-rust-5a1g).

## Starting Up
After cloning:
```
npm i && npm run build && npm run start
```
Should now be viewable at `localhost:8080`.
